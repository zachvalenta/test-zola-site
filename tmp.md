* Github has a job profile?

### AI

> LLMs are good at explaining code. Give it code in a language you don't understand and it will explain it with 90% accuracy. https://katherinemichel.github.io/portfolio/pycon-us-2024-recap.html#simon-willison-keynote

* what i use it for: tool recs, big picture questions, learning new concepts (regression, dimensional analysis)
* supercharged smart young people https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmiwV8kUz2E https://www.bitecode.dev/p/what-if-ai-eventually-make-programmers
* the role of web search
* teaching people how to ask better questions https://paulgraham.com/writes.html
* https://www.fwdaudio.com/ https://x.com/barbell_fi
* punishes languages with bad semantics e.g. SQL CTE's https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/481/python-opinions-and-zeitgeist-with-hynek
* Stack Overflow won in losing https://x.com/Altimor/status/1853893158368928124
> https://paulgraham.com/writes.html PG might be right for most people but I estimate that LLMs will actually make their users *better* at writing clearly. Will take the Stack Overflow ethos to a wider audience. https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask

> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42095434 there's a fair amount of pushback as well. i align with the first comment to this guy. decent amount of pushback seems like: "im a real man, my editor is emacs, i have strong opinions about c99 vs. rust, LLMs are for homos who write $DYNAMICALLY_TYPED_LANGUAGE_HERE" + people that are bad at writing prompts. essentially, LLMs reward the type of person who could write a good question on Stack Overflow or otherwise teaches them how to do so (if they are willing to learn) https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve - to Josh/Kurt 24.11.15

* ML doesn't think, only answers, and therefore can be hacked
> In 2017, M.I.T.’s LabSix—a research group of undergraduate and graduate students—succeeded in altering the pixels of a photograph of a cat so that, although it looked like a cat to human eyes, Inception became 99.99-per-cent sure it had been given a photograph of guacamole. (There was, it calculated, a slim chance that the photograph showed broccoli, or mortar.) Inception, of course, can’t explain what features led it to conclude that a cat is a cat; as a result, there’s no easy way to predict how it might fail when presented with specially crafted or corrupted data. Such a system is likely to have unknown gaps in its accuracy that amount to vulnerabilities for a smart and determined attacker. - https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-hidden-costs-of-automated-thinking
> Well, in the past, if a software engineer wanted to create a system to recognise something, they would write logical steps (‘rules’). To recognise a cat in a picture, you would write rules to find edges, fur, legs, eyes, pointed ears and so on, and bolt them all together and hope it worked. The trouble was that though this works in theory, in practice it’s rather like trying to make a mechanical horse - it’s theoretically possible, but the decree of complexity required is impractical. We can’t actually describe all of the logical steps we use to walk, or to recognise a cat. With machine learning, instead of writing rules, you give examples (lots of examples) to a statistical engine, and that engine generates a model that can tell the difference. You give it 100,000 pictures labelled ‘cat’ and 100,000 labelled ‘no cat’ and the machine works out the difference. ML replaces hand-written logical steps with automatically determined patterns in data, and works much better for a very broad class of question - https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/12/19/does-ai-make-strong-tech-companies-stronger
* need data specific to problem
> First, though you need a lot of data for machine learning, the data you use is very specific to the problem that you’re trying to solve. GE has lots of telemetry data from gas turbines, Google has lots of search data, and Amex has lots of credit card fraud data. You can’t use the turbine data as examples to spot fraudulent transactions, and you can’t use web searches to spot gas turbines that are about to fail. https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/12/19/does-ai-make-strong-tech-companies-stronger
