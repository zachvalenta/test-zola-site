__What is DX?__

'DX' means 'dev experience'.

__Why coin a neologism?__

Developers lack a succinct way to characterize a software library's ease of use. The closest thing I've seen is ['programmer happiness'](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/). 'Ergonomics' also works, although 4 syllables makes it unlikely to catch on. 

__Is this like UX (user experience)?__

Yes.

__Why should I care about DX?__

For the same reasons you care about UX: if your project is unpleasant to use, other developers won't use it.
