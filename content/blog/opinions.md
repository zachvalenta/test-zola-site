CURRENT OPINIONS
* Clarity trumps all other concerns.
* Bad code can be written in any paradigm.
* So called "best practices" are contextual and not broadly applicable. Blindly following them makes you an idiot.
> meh
* In general, RDBMS > NoSql.

> these two seem to have been in the original article but later edited out
* The word "scalable" has a mystical and stupefying power over the mind of the software engineer. Its mere utterance can whip them into a depraved frenzy. Grim actions have been justified using this word
* Despite being called "engineers" most decisions are pure cargo-cult with no backing analysis, data, or numbers.

* The top ~10% of project managers are wildly underrated in importance and the other ~90% could disappear tomorrow to either no effect or a net gain in efficiency.
* Interviewing in tech is folkloric and irrational and also seems to be as good or better than most industries.
