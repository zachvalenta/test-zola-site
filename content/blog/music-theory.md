How I Would Explain Music Theory

There's harmony, melody, and rhythm.

Rhythm you already know.

Melody is notes played individually. Harmony is notes played simultaneously.

What makes both harmony and melody work are intervals.

Intervals are the distance between notes. For example, C and D have an interval between them. A C chord has intervals between each of the notes in the chord.

Every two notes in a melody and every note in a chord have an interval between them.
