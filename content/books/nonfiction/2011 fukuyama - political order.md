## tldr

These two books are about political order from 10,000 BC to the present.

Political order = political institutions = the state, rule of law, accountability.

## why bother reading this book?

To understand why countries have failed (e.g. Qing China, contemporary Greece) or succeeded (Song China, 19th century Germany) at different points in human history.

## institutions do not necessarily progress

Some countries start strong, then get stuck (middle income trap).

Some countries are laggards, then suddenly catch up.
