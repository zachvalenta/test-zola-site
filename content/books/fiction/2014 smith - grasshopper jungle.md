## tldr

Disaster flick crossed with rom com starring two midwestern teens. Austin and Robby, our two midwestern teens, undiscouraged by surplus of mutant insect-induced carnage.

## indicative quotes

> We sat there sitting and smoking. Everything was shitty and confusing. Robby felt terrible. [45]

> It’s good to have a cigarette with your best friend [96]

## why bother?

Fun and funny and sweet. Galloping story. Characters you will like. The book is really YA in label only, so don't be scared off by that.

## miscellanea

sexuality

> Queer is just a word. Like orange. I know who you are. There’s no one word for that. [120]

history

> The book would be as big as the universe, and it would take multiple countless lifetimes to read. History necessarily had to be an abbreviation. [67]
 
> You could never get everything in a book. Good book are always about everything. [76]
