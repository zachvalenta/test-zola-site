## indicative quotes

> Los Angeles, give me some of you! Los Angeles come to me the way I came to you, my feet over your streets, you pretty town I loved you so much, you sad flower in the sand, you pretty town. [page 13]

> A prayer. Sure, one prayer: for sentimental reasons. Almighty God, I am sorry I am now an atheist, but have you read Nietzsche? Ah, such a book! Almighty God, I will play fair in this. I will make You a proposition. Make a great writer out of me, and I will return to the Church. [page 22]

> "I didn't know you had freckles." / "They don't mean anything." [page 42]

## why bother?

Puts you in a reckless mood.

The beach chapter is awesome (in the original sense of the word).
