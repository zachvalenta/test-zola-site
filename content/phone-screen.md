## longer version

* I graduated university with a degree in English but got interested in China and __after graduation I moved to China__ to learn the language.
* Once my Chinese was good, __I worked for Johns Hopkins University__ in a Chinese-speaking role.
* While I worked for JHU, I paired up with my friend [Dror](https://www.drorpoleg.com/) and __operated a media startup called Buy Buy China__ to consult on consumer-facing Chinese tech companies.
* Consumer tech led to software, so I __moved back to America and went to a dev bootcamp__.
* I worked at __JP Morgan__ and mostly did backend (Java, Python, PHP).
* I did a sabbatical in London.
* I contracted for __Capital One__ and __BNYM__ and did backend (Django, Flask).
* I did a sabbatical fixing up an old house.
* I went to [__United Masters__](https://unitedmasters.com/) and worked on payments (Python).
* Since then I'm at [__Capp__](https://cappusa.com/) working on data engineering.
